C - Function Pointers
======================


**Array of Function Pointers**
---------------------------------

The code snippet `void (*fptr[10])()` declares an array of function pointers in C. Here's a breakdown of its components:

**1. `void`:** This specifies the return type of the functions the pointers will point to. In this case, they will return `void`, meaning they don't return any value.

**2. `*`:** This is the pointer declaration operator. It indicates that the elements of the array will be pointers.

**3. `fptr`:** This is the name of the array. You can choose any descriptive name for your array.

**4. `[10]`:** This specifies the size of the array. Here, it can hold 10 function pointers.

**5. `()`:** These parentheses are part of the function pointer declaration. They define that the pointers will point to functions that take no arguments.

**In essence, this code declares an array named `fptr` that can store 10 pointers to functions that all return `void` and take no arguments.**

Here's an example of how you might use this array:

.. code-block:: c++

    void function1() {
      // Do something
    }

    void function2() {
      // Do something else
    }

    int main() {
      // Initialize the array with function addresses
      void (*fptr[10])() = {function1, function2, /* ... more functions */};

      // Call functions through the array
      for (int i = 0; i < 10; ++i) {
        if (fptr[i] != nullptr) { // Check for null pointers (optional)
          fptr[i]();
        }
      }

      return 0;
    }

In this example:

- Two functions, `function1` and `function2`, are defined.
- The `fptr` array is initialized with the addresses of these functions.
- A loop iterates through the array, calling each function pointed to by the elements (if they are not null pointers).

**Key Points:**

- Function pointers are a powerful tool for achieving polymorphism in C.
- You can use them to create flexible and dynamic code.
- Be cautious when working with function pointers, as they can introduce errors if not handled properly (e.g., null pointer dereference).
