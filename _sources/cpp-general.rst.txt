C++ - General
======================

**`const` usage in C++ classes**
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

**Here's a comprehensive explanation of `const` usage in C++ classes:**


**1. `const` Objects:**

* **Declaration:** `const ClassName objectName;`
* **Meaning:** The object's state cannot be modified after its creation.
* **Restrictions:**
    - Only const member functions can be called on it.
    - It cannot be used as the left operand of assignment operators.
* **Example:**

.. code-block:: c++

   const Date today(2024, 1, 18);  // today's date cannot be changed
   today.print();                  // Calling a const member function

**2. `const` Member Functions:**

* **Declaration:** `ReturnType functionName() const;`
* **Meaning:** The function promises not to modify the object's state.
* **Restrictions:**
    - It cannot modify any non-mutable members of the class.
    - It can only call other const member functions.
* **Example:**

.. code-block:: c++

   class Date {
   public:
       void print() const { ... }  // Can be called on const objects
   };

**3. `const` Data Members:**

* **Declaration:** `const DataType memberName;`
* **Meaning:** The member variable must be initialized in the constructor and cannot be changed afterward.
* **Restrictions:**
    - It can only be initialized in the constructor's initialization list.
* **Example:**

.. code-block:: c++

   class Employee {
   public:
       Employee(const std::string& name) : name(name) {}
   private:
       const std::string name;  // Employee's name cannot be changed
   };

**4. `mutable` Member Variables:**

* **Declaration:** `mutable DataType memberName;`
* **Meaning:** This member can be modified even within const member functions.
* **Use Case:** Often used for caching values or for internal state that doesn't affect the object's logical state.
* **Example:**

.. code-block:: c++

   class Date {
   public:
       int getDayOfYear() const {
           if (!dayOfYearCalculated) {
               calculateDayOfYear();  // Can modify dayOfYear despite being const
           }
           return dayOfYear;
       }
   private:
       mutable int dayOfYear = 0;  // Can be modified even in const functions
       mutable bool dayOfYearCalculated = false;
   };

**Key Points:**

* Use `const` objects to protect data integrity and prevent unintended modifications.
* Use `const` member functions to clarify which functions don't modify the object's state.
* Use `const` data members to ensure constant values within the class.
* Use `mutable` data members sparingly for specific cases where modification is necessary within const member functions.

-----------------

**`const` in the function**
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**Here's a breakdown of the use of `const` in the function `void function() const`:**

**1. Declares a Member Function:**
   - The `void function()` part declares a member function named `function` that belongs to a class.
   - It doesn't return any value (indicated by `void`).

**2. Enforces a "Read-Only" Promise:**
   - The `const` keyword after the function's parameter list signifies that this function is a **const member function**.
   - It guarantees that this function will **not modify any non-mutable member variables** of the object it's called on.

**Key Implications:**

* **Object State Preservation:** Const member functions ensure that the object's state remains unchanged after their execution, promoting data integrity and preventing unintended side effects.
* **Const Object Compatibility:** Const member functions can be called on both const and non-const objects, making them more versatile.
* **Overload Resolution:** Const member functions can be overloaded based on their constness, providing different versions for read-only and potentially modifying operations.
* **Encapsulation and Safety:** They help enforce class invariants and prevent accidental modifications, making code more reliable and maintainable.

**Example:**

.. code-block:: c++

    class Circle {
    public:
        double radius;

        // Non-const member function that can modify radius
        void setRadius(double newRadius) {
            radius = newRadius;
        }

        // Const member function that can only access radius, not modify it
        double getArea() const {
            return 3.14159 * radius * radius;
        }
    };

**In summary:**

* Use `const` member functions to explicitly declare that a function won't modify the object's state.
* This makes code more readable, maintainable, and safer by preventing accidental modifications.


**Other Explanation**



In C++, when you declare a member function with `const` after the closing parenthesis like this:

.. code-block:: c++

    void func() const {}

It makes the function itself a **const member function**. This has a few key implications:

**1. Promises Not to Modify Member Variables:**

* A `const` member function guarantees that it will not modify any non-static member variables (`this` object) of the class.
* This is useful for member functions that only access or perform calculations based on the object's state without changing it.

**2. Read-Only Access:**

* By convention, `const` member functions typically indicate they primarily provide read-only access to the object's data.

**3. Usage Scenarios:**

* Getter functions (accessors) that return the values of member variables without modifying them.
* Member functions that perform calculations based on the object's state but don't alter it (e.g., calculating length of a string).

**Example:**

.. code-block:: c++

    class Point {
    public:
        int x, y;

        // Getter function (const member function)
        int getX() const {
            return x;  // Accesses x but doesn't modify it
        }

        // Mutator function (not const)
        void setX(int newX) {
            x = newX;  // Modifies x
        }
    };

**Benefits of Using `const` Member Functions:**

* **Enhances Code Clarity:** Clearly communicates the function's intent (read-only access).
* **Prevents Accidental Modifications:** Helps avoid unintended changes to the object's state.
* **Enables Calls from Const Objects:** Allows calling the function even on constant objects of the class.

**Key Points:**

* Use `const` member functions when you want to guarantee a function doesn't modify the object's state.
* It promotes code safety and readability.
* Consider using non-const member functions when modifications are necessary.

**Determining System Endianness**
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

There are a few ways to determine whether your system uses big-endian or little-endian format:

1. **Preprocessor Macros:** Some compilers define preprocessor macros like `__BYTE_ORDER__` or `_BIG_ENDIAN` depending on the system's endianness. However, this approach might not be portable across different compilers.

2. **Manual Check:** You can write a small C program that explicitly assigns a value to a multi-byte variable (e.g., integer) and then prints the memory representation using a pointer cast. This involves inspecting the order of bytes in the printed output.

.. code-block:: c++

   #include <iostream>

   int main() {
       int value = 0x01234567;
       unsigned char* ptr = reinterpret_cast<unsigned char*>(&value);

       std::cout << "Memory representation: ";
       for (int i = 0; i < sizeof(int); ++i) {
           std::cout << std::hex << static_cast<int>(ptr[i]) << " ";
       }
       std::cout << std::endl;

       return 0;
   }

   - In a big-endian system, the most significant byte (MSB) will be printed first.
   - In a little-endian system, the least significant byte (LSB) will be printed first.

3. **System-Specific Checks:** You might find system-specific utilities or header files that provide information about the endianness. Consult your system documentation for details.

## Converting Between Endianness

Here are common approaches for converting between big-endian and little-endian formats:

1. **Manual Swapping:** You can write a function that iterates through the byte representation of the data and swaps the order of bytes. This approach can be error-prone and less efficient for large data structures.

2. **Bitwise Operators:** For simple data types like integers, you can use bitwise operators (e.g., `<<`, `>>`) to shift bytes to their appropriate positions based on the target endianness.

.. code-block:: c

   // Example: Swap bytes of an integer (assuming 4 bytes)
   int value = 0x01234567;
   if (isLittleEndian()) {
       value = (value >> 24) | ((value >> 8) & 0x0000FF00) | ((value << 8) & 0x00FF0000) | (value << 24);
   }

3. **Endian-Neutral Libraries:** Consider using libraries like Boost.Endian or third-party libraries specifically designed for endianness conversion. These libraries provide functions with well-defined behavior for data type conversions.

**Important Considerations:**

* Be aware of the data type you're converting and the number of bytes it occupies.
* Ensure proper handling of signed and unsigned values during conversion.
* For network communication, consider using standard network byte order (usually big-endian) to avoid inconsistencies across different architectures.

Choose the approach that best suits your requirements, considering factors like code complexity, performance, and portability needs.
