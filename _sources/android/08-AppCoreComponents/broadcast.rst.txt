08-AppCoreComponents - Broadcast Receivers 
============================================
Broadcast receiver are one of the four core android components. Broadcast Receivers are intended to be used to receive and respond to broadcast messages from other applications or from the system. An app can also initiate broadcasts to let other apps know that some resource will be available to the device and soon will be available for them to use. An example for broadcast receiver can be when WiFi is turned on or off it is broadcasted to the system and broadcast receiver who will intercept this communication and will initiate appropriate action.

A broadcast receiver is implemented as a subclass of BroadcastReceiver class and each message is broadcasted as an Intent object.
