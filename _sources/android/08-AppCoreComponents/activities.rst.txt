08-AppCoreComponents - Activities 
=====================================
An Activity is an application component that provides a screen with which users can interact in order to do something, such as dial the phone, take a photo, send an email, or view a map. Each activity is given a window in which to draw its user interface. The window typically fills the screen, but may be smaller than the screen and float on top of other windows.

Creating an Activity:
------------------------
To create an activity, you must create a subclass of Activity (or an existing subclass of it). In your subclass, you need to implement callback methods that the system calls when the activity transitions between various states of its lifecycle, such as when the activity is being created, stopped, resumed, or destroyed.

Template:

.. code-block:: 

    public class ExampleActivity extends Activity {
        @Override
        public void onCreate(Bundle savedInstanceState) {
            super.onCreate(savedInstanceState);
            // The activity is being created.
        }

        @Override
        protected void onStart() {
            super.onStart();
            // The activity is about to become visible.
        }

        @Override
        protected void onResume() {
            super.onResume();
            // The activity has become visible (it is now "resumed")
        }

        @Override
        protected void onPause() {
            super.onPause();
            // Another activity is taking focus (this activity is about to be "paused").
        }

        @Override
        protected void onStop() {
            super.onStop();
            // The activity is no longer visible (it is now "stopped")
        }

        @Override
        protected void onDestroy() {
            super.onDestroy();
            // The activity is about to be destroyed
        }
    }
