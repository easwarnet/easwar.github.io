**Features**
--------------------------

Application framework
------------------------
Android provides Framework that is used for both Java App development and 
C++ based Native Application Devlopment.

ART - Android RunTime
------------------------
Android runtime (ART) is the managed runtime used by applications and system 
services on Android. ART are run runtimes that runs Dex bytecode. Features of 
ART includes Ahead-of-time (AOT) compilation, Garbage collection, Development 
and Debugging, Profiling Support for tracing application execution.

Integrated browser
------------------------
Android provides WebKit based browser. WebView Class can be used for integrating 
WebKit engine in app development.

Optimized graphics
------------------------
Android provides 2D and OpenGL based 3D graphics Libraries.

SQLite
------------------------
SQLite is the Standard database used in Android. It can be used through the 
Application Framwork.

Media support
------------------------
AndroidX Media is collection of libraries that supports wide range of media formats 
and media codecs.

GSM telephony support
------------------------
Telephony support for 3G, Edge, Bluetooth and WiFi is largely dependant on Hardware 
chipsets. Android provides HAL (Hardware Abstraction Layer) support to interface 
with the respective hardware chipset. While the upper layers of Stack is handled 
by Android similair to Linux.

Camera, GPS, compass, and accelerometer
------------------------------------------------
Hardware support for Camera, GPS, compass, and accelerometer is largely dependant 
on Hardware chipsets. Android provides HAL support to interface with the respective 
hardware chipset.

**Hardware Compatibility**
-----------------------------

Android has specified few compatibility specifications. Some of the important compatibility 
specifications have been mentioned below in this chapter. More specifications can be referred 
to under the link provided in References. Here’s a quick summary:

Memory
----------
- Must have at least 6 GB of physical memory.
- Must have at least 1 GB of RAM. On being less than 1 GB ActivityManager#isLowRamDevice 
  must be set to true.

Performance
------------
- Must support sequential write performance of at least 100 MB/s.
- Must support random write performance of at least 10 MB/s.
- Must support sequential read performance of at least 200 MB/s.
- Must support random read performance of at least 25 MB/s.

Screen Resolution
--------------------
- Must support screen density of at least 400dpi pixel density
- Must Support 1080p resolution
- Must have a physical diagonal screen size of atleast 3.3 inches.

Hardware
----------
- Rear camera must have a 12MP rear camera capable of 4K 30 FPS recording.
- Front camera must be at least 4MP and support 1080P 30fps recording.

Multimedia
-----------
- Must support audio encoding and decoding formats such as AMR-NB, AMR-WB, 
  MPEG-4 AAC Profile (AAC LC), MPEG-4 HE AAC Profile (AAC+), AAC ELD (enhanced low delay AAC)
- Must support video encoding formats such as H.264 AVC, VP8.
- Must support video decoding formats such as H.264 AVC, H.265 HEVC, MPEG-4 SP, VP8, VP9.

**Characteristics**
-----------------------------

Brief
------
In addition to its basic feature set, the Android platform has a few characteristics that make it an especially interesting platform for embedded development. Here’s a quick summary:

Development Environment
-------------------------
Android provides Tools, IDEs and SDK to support development and maintenance of Project. Android provides Emulator, SDK, NDK, Android Studio which consists of tools for profiling, log monitorin for development. While tools for Maintenance and test includes CTS, VTS and so on.

App Ecosystem
---------------
Google provides Playstore for incremental release of Apps.

API Libraries
---------------
Android provides API Libraries along with usage tutorials.


Multi Layer Decoupling
-------------------------
Android is largely decoupled. Meaning that if a hardware, hal, library or a layer is meant to be replaced/improved, the upper layers or API calls still should not be impacted.

Customizable
---------------
Android provides options to create, customize Frameworks, Features and HAL.
