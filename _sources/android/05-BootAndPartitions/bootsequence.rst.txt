05-BootAndPartitions - Boot Sequence 
=======================================
This topic explains how Android Boots from when its powered on till Android UI starts to run.

Primary Bootloader
-----------------------
Primary Bootloader is first pice of code that executes on Power-ON. Primary Bootloader is located on Boot ROM of the processor. The functionality of the primary bootloader is to verify the authenticity of the secondary bootloader and load it. Usually if primary bootloader fails to load the Secondary Bootloader, it will load EDL or Emergency Download Mode, which is compatible with Fastboot. The EDL Mode shall prompt us in flashing the new software on to the device.

Secondary Bootloader
-----------------------
Secondary Bootloader usually resides on a NAND based eMMC. The secondary bootloader is responsible for initializing and setting Networks, RAM, Flash Memory and so on. Once the secondary bootloader is successfully loaded, its functionality is to invoke TrustZone, which verifies integrity of each images. More covered on topic Android Partitions.

Kernel
----------
Secondary bootloader then passes the control to Kernel. Seconday Bootloader shares DTBO memory region with Kernel, where Hardware topology and hardcoded information is found. The Kernel used in Android is modified version of Linux Kernel. Kernel initializes the complete Scheduler, Process Subsystem, Memory Subsystem, Hardware Drivers and so on. Android Kernel also consist of additional modules such as Binder, Ashmem (Android Shared Memory), Drivers for ADB (Android Debug Bridge), Wakelocks, Logcat Support, OOM_handler (Low Memory Handling) and so on. Kernel then loads the initramfs.

Initramfs
-------------
On Android, like on many Linux-based systems, the kernel first mounts an initramfs on /init/. initramfs is a RAM based filesystem that mounts the actual root filsystem at /, thereby replacing the initramfs. Android keeps the initramfs mounted forever. Android's initramfs contains only /init, adbd and a few configuration files.

RootFS
-----------
Once the Root filesystem is mounted it tries to execute the very first process init.

Init Process
----------------
Init is the first process that executes once the rootfs mounted. Init runs init.rc script. Refer init.rc topic for more details.

Zygote
------------
Android Framework starts loading and Zygote is considered to be the first service started by Android. Zygote is spawned by the init process, which is responsible for starting Android applications and service processes. It loads and initializes classes that are supposed to be used very often into the heap. For example, dex data structures of libraries. After Zygote has started, it listens for commands on a socket. When a new applications starts, a command is sends to Zygote which executes a fork() system call.

System Services
-----------------------
Zygote forks and launches multiple core system services such as Power manager, Activity Manager, Telephony, Battery service, Alarm manager, Sensor service, Bluetooth service, Location Services and so on.
